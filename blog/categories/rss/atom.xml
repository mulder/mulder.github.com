    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Does anybody take the time to visit blogs anymore?  I don't.  Back in 2005 I found google reader and started to subscribe to hundreds of RSS feeds.  I Rare visited a blog unless of course it is my first visit.  Once the blog is in my RSS feed there is really no reason to go back.  Also my RSS is becoming a little outdated.  I've trimmed it down to 80 or so. Of those about 20 post daily.  Even those I don't really check up on any more.</p>

<p>Once every couple of weeks I'll start up <a href="http://reederapp.com">reeder</a> and click through and clean them out.  It's a chore.  Between Twitter and podcasts the contents of my RSS feeds are all old news by the time I get to them.  It used to be exciting.  It used to be all about discovery.  Now it's just mundane.  Now it's just a routine.</p>

<p>Am I doing it wrong?  Or have Blogs/RSS simply become obsolete?</p>
